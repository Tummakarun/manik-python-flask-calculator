To create a virtual environment for your Flask application, follow these steps:

## Install virtualenv if you haven't already:

```
sudo apt-get install python3-virtualenv

```
Navigate to the project directory (the folder containing app.py).
## Create a new virtual environment:


```
python3 -m venv venv
```
Activate the virtual environment:

```
source venv/bin/activate
```
Install the required packages:

```
pip install Flask
```
Run the Flask application:

```
python app.py
```

Now your Flask application is running in a virtual environment on your Ubuntu machine.

To deactivate the virtual environment, simply run:


```
deactivate
```
